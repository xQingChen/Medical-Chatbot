        Mononucleosis, often referred to as "mono" or the "kissing disease," is an infectious illness typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most common among teenagers and young adults, particularly those between the ages of 15 and 30. The virus is primarily spread through saliva, which is why it is often associated with kissing, though it can also spread through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils or drinks.

    <ol>
        <li> Causes:
            <ul>
                <li>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): The most common cause of mononucleosis, primarily transmitted through saliva.</li>
                <li>Other Viruses: In rare cases, other viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, or hepatitis A can cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2">
        <li> Symptoms:
            <ul>
                <li>Fatigue: A profound, overwhelming tiredness that can last for weeks or even months.</li>
                <li>Sore Throat: Often severe, and may resemble strep throat.</li>
                <li>Fever: Usually mild to moderate.</li>
                <li>Swollen Lymph Nodes: Particularly in the neck and armpits.</li>
                <li>Swollen Tonsils: The tonsils may be red and covered with white or yellowish spots.</li>
                <li>Headache: A persistent dull headache.</li>
                <li>Skin Rash: Some people develop a rash, especially if treated with antibiotics like amoxicillin or ampicillin.</li>
                <li>Swollen Spleen: In some cases, the spleen can become enlarged, causing upper left abdominal pain.</li>
                <li>Muscle Aches: General body aches, similar to flu symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
        <li> Treatment:
            <ul>
                <li>Rest: The best treatment is rest. Patients should get plenty of rest to help their body fight the infection.</li>
                <li>Hydration: Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and help alleviate sore throat symptoms.</li>
                <li>Pain Relief: Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve sore throat and headaches.</li>
                <li>Gargling: Gargling with warm salt water several times a day can help soothe a sore throat.</li>
                <li>Avoid Antibiotics: Antibiotics are not effective against viruses like EBV and should not be used unless there is a secondary bacterial infection.</li>
                <li>Monitoring Complications: Seek medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, or extreme fatigue that worsens.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4">
        <li> Prevention:
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid Sharing Personal Items: Do not share drinks, food, eating utensils, toothbrushes, or lip balm with others.</li>
                <li>Practice Good Hygiene: Wash hands frequently with soap and water, especially after sneezing, coughing, or touching your face.</li>
                <li>Avoid Kissing Someone Who Has Mono: Since EBV is primarily spread through saliva, avoid kissing or close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with mononucleosis.</li>
                <li>Strengthen Your Immune System: Maintain a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and ensure adequate sleep to support your immune system.</li>
                <li>No Vaccine: Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent mononucleosis, so awareness and preventive measures are essential.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
