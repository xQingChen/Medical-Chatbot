      <strong>1. Determine Your Goals:</strong><br>
      Focus on muscle size (hypertrophy) as the primary goal. Consider secondary goals like improving strength, endurance, or overall fitness.<br><br>

      <strong>2. Assess Your Current Fitness Level:</strong><br>
      Evaluate your experience, strength levels, and body composition to tailor your program effectively.<br><br>

      <strong>3. Choose Your Training Split:</strong><br>
      Decide on a workout split based on your experience level and available training days. Options include Full-Body Workouts, Upper/Lower Split, Push/Pull/Legs, or Body Part Split.<br><br>

      <strong>4. Select Exercises:</strong><br>
      Prioritize compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses for overall muscle growth. Include isolation exercises to target specific muscles.<br><br>

      <strong>5. Determine Volume and Intensity:</strong><br>
      Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise. Use a challenging weight with proper form. Start with 10-12 sets per muscle group per week, increasing as you progress. Rest 60-90 seconds between sets.<br><br>

      <strong>6. Plan Progression:</strong><br>
      Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time to challenge your muscles continuously. Include deload weeks every 4-6 weeks for recovery.<br><br>

      <strong>7. Incorporate Periodization:</strong><br>
      Use different periodization techniques like Linear, Undulating, or Block Periodization to vary intensity and volume.<br><br>

      <strong>8. Consider Recovery:</strong><br>
      Ensure proper recovery through adequate sleep (7-9 hours), nutrition, and rest days. Focus on protein intake (1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight).<br><br>

      <strong>9. Track Your Progress:</strong><br>
      Keep a workout log, track body measurements, and adjust your program based on progress or plateaus.<br><br>

      <strong>10. Stay Consistent:</strong><br>
      Consistency is key to success. Stick to your plan, stay motivated, and celebrate small victories along the way.<br><br>
