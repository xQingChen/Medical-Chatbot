      <strong>1. Define Your Goals:</strong><br>
      Focus on increasing strength as your primary goal. Consider secondary goals such as improving muscle size, endurance, or overall fitness.<br><br>

      <strong>2. Assess Your Current Fitness Level:</strong><br>
      Identify whether you are a beginner, intermediate, or advanced lifter. Know your current maximum lifts (1-rep max) for major exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. Be aware of any injuries or limitations.<br><br>

      <strong>3. Choose Your Training Split:</strong><br>
      Decide on a training split based on your experience level and available training days. Options include Full-Body Workouts, Upper/Lower Split, or Push/Pull/Legs.<br><br>

      <strong>4. Select Exercises:</strong><br>
      Focus on compound movements that engage multiple muscle groups, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses. Include accessory lifts to target specific weaknesses.<br><br>

      <strong>5. Determine Volume and Intensity:</strong><br>
      For strength, focus on lower reps (3-6) with higher weight, typically 3-5 sets per exercise. Use 70-90% of your 1-rep max. Rest 2-5 minutes between sets.<br><br>

      <strong>6. Plan Progression:</strong><br>
      Gradually increase the weight over time to continue building strength. Incorporate periodization with cycles of increasing and decreasing intensity.<br><br>

      <strong>7. Incorporate Recovery:</strong><br>
      Ensure adequate rest between heavy lifting days, prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep, and focus on a diet rich in protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats.<br><br>

      <strong>8. Track Your Progress:</strong><br>
      Keep a detailed log of exercises, sets, reps, and weights. Regularly test your 1-rep max to measure progress and adjust your program as needed.<br><br>

      <strong>9. Stay Consistent:</strong><br>
      Consistency is key for building strength. Stick to your plan, stay motivated, and avoid unnecessary changes.<br><br>

      <strong>10. Consider Supplementation (Optional):</strong><br>
      Consider using creatine for strength and power, and protein supplements to meet daily intake goals. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation.<br><br>
