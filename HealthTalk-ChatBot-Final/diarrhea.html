        Diarrhea is a condition characterized by the frequent passage of loose, watery stools. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (lasting more than four weeks). While diarrhea is often mild and resolves on its own, it can sometimes be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, especially if it persists or is accompanied by other symptoms.
