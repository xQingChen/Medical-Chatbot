    <p> 
        Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane that lines your eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. When the small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become inflamed, they become more visible, causing the whites of your eyes to appear reddish or pink. Conjunctivitis can be highly contagious and is common among children, though it can affect people of all ages.
